# Prerequisites

You need python installed first and the python library PIL

PIL is installed in the Windows terminal after Python is installed
```
pip install pillow
```
# Running the app

After starting the app you will be prompted to select the installation folder for Victoria 2, this is because this app comes without any graphical elements and only uses what comes with the game.
